# NPM

npm means node package manager
whenver we are writing code in a langauge, we need libraries,
Libraries are bundles of code available on the internet for free use
npm is used for installing libraires into our code
npm is installed along with NodeJS

The command to install libraries is:
-  `npm install react`
-  `npm install`

Running the first command, the package `react` will be installed in that folder.
Running the second command, all the packages mentioned in the package.json will be installed in that folder

- A simulator mimics the basic behavior of a device.
- An emulator duplicates the thing exactly as it exists in real life.

# REACT

A react component is a function that returns JSX. JSX looks similar to HTML.
